# ngrx-component-store-entities

This repo contains different examples of how to use @ngrx/component-store together with @ngrx/entity

Roadmap of this project:
1. Implement CRUD operations for user management
2. Add Elements 2 and create simple forms to manage users
3. Add some unit-tests in karma/jasmine

Then, we may discuss and add here different things:
- Create a separate account on Mockapi to share it across everybody
- Convert it in NX
- Angular 16 with signals
- Add examples of e2e tests with Webdriver.io
- Nest.js as a Backend
- docker containers
- Postgres DB
- deploy it to Azure sandbox as web app
- Add simple CI/CD to build, run tests and then deploy

Later in the bright future this repo might be used as:
- a sandbox to test some hypotheses
- example of a particular technology or approach
- an initial repo for a bootcamp for new devs
- during the interview process
